Networking Fundamentals – OSI Model, Layers, and Protocols
1. Routing and Routing Protocols
Routing is the process of selecting the best path for data to travel from source to destination.
Routers choose the best path using routing algorithms.

Types of Routing Protocols
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) – Uses shortest path algorithm.
RIP (Routing Information Protocol) – Uses hop count to determine best route.

OSI Model (Open System Interconnection Model)
A conceptual model that standardizes communication between devices.

Divides networking into 7 layers.
Each layer has its own function.
Data moves through layers using a process called encapsulation.

OSI Layers (Top to Bottom)

Physical

Encapsulation
Each layer adds its own information to the data.
This added information is called a header.
Process ensures proper communication between devices.

Physical Layer (Layer 1)
Concerned with hardware components.
Responsible for transmitting raw bits (1s and 0s).
Uses electrical signals.
Example: Ethernet cables.

Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
Handles physical addressing using MAC address.
Responsible for error detection.
Converts packets into frames.
Works within a local network.
Addressing
IP Address → Logical address (used for communication between networks).
MAC Address → Physical address (used inside local network).

Network Layer (Layer 3)
Uses logical addressing (IP).
Responsible for routing data between networks.
Determines best path for packet delivery.

Transport Layer (Layer 4)
Ensures reliable or unreliable data delivery.
Provides end-to-end communication.
Handles segmentation and reassembly.
Protocols
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Reliable connection-oriented protocol.
Ensures data is delivered correctly.
Uses acknowledgments and error checking.
Slower but more secure and accurate.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Connectionless protocol.
Faster but does not guarantee delivery.
Used in streaming, gaming, VoIP.
Connection-Oriented vs Connectionless
Connection-Oriented → Reliable, confirmation required (TCP).
Connectionless → Faster, no confirmation (UDP).
Advantages of TCP
Reliable communication.
Error detection and correction.
Ordered data delivery.
Suitable for important data transfer.
Disadvantages of TCP
Slower compared to UDP.
More overhead due to acknowledgments.
Key Concepts Learned
Routing selects best path for data.
OSI model divides networking into 7 layers.
Encapsulation adds headers at each layer.
IP = Logical address.
MAC = Physical address.
TCP = Reliable.
UDP = Fast.
