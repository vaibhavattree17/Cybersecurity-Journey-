1. Networking Basics

A network is a group of connected devices.

The Internet is a massive network made up of many smaller networks.

There are two main types of networks:

Private Network

Public Network

2. IP Addressing (Internet Protocol)

An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.

IPv4 consists of:

4 octets

Each octet = 8 bits

Total = 32 bits

Example:

192.168.1.10

Each octet ranges from 0–255

3. MAC Address (Media Access Control)

A MAC address is a unique hardware address assigned to a device’s network interface.

Assigned at the factory.

12 hexadecimal characters.

Example:

A4:C3:60:85:AC:2D

Can be faked using MAC Spoofing.

Spoofing can bypass poorly implemented security systems that trust devices based only on MAC address.

4. Network Devices
Switch

Connects multiple devices in a LAN.

Keeps track of which device is connected to which port.

Sends data only to the target device (unlike a hub).

Router

Connects different networks.

Passes data between networks.

Responsible for routing traffic to external networks (like the Internet).

5. Network Topologies

Bus Topology

All devices share a single backbone cable.

Ring Topology

Devices are connected in a loop.

Star Topology

Devices are connected individually to a central device (switch or hub).

6. Subnetting

Subnetting divides a large network into smaller networks.

Done using a Subnet Mask.

Example:

IP: 192.168.1.10

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

CIDR Notation: 192.168.1.0/24

/24 Meaning

Total addresses: 256

Usable hosts: 254

1 address reserved for:

Network ID

1 address reserved for:

Broadcast

Address Types in a Subnet

Network Address

Host Address

Broadcast Address

Default Gateway

7. Broadcast Address

Sends data to all devices in the subnet.

Reserved address.

Example for 192.168.1.0/24:

Broadcast: 192.168.1.255

8. Default Gateway

The router’s IP inside the subnet.

Used when a device wants to access external networks.

Example:

192.168.1.1

9. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

Used to define subnet size.

Examples:

/24 → 254 usable hosts

/25 → 126 usable hosts

/26 → 62 usable hosts

/27 → 30 usable hosts

/28 → 14 usable hosts

10. Ping (ICMP)

A network troubleshooting tool.

Uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).

Sends Echo Request.

Receives Echo Reply.

Measures round-trip time.

Syntax:

ping <IP address>

ping <website>

11. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Maps IP address to MAC address.

Stores mappings in ARP cache.

Process:

Device sends ARP request (broadcast).

Target device replies with its MAC address.

Mapping is stored for future use.

12. Subnetting Security Benefits

Limits attack spread.

Separates sensitive systems.

Controls internal access.

Reduces broadcast traffic.

13. Offensive Security

Breaking into systems ethically.

Exploiting bugs and vulnerabilities.

Finding loopholes in applications.

Goal: Understand attacker techniques to improve defense.

Dirb

Used for directory and file brute forcing.

Discovers hidden folders on websites.

Example:

dirb http://target-site.com

14. Defensive Security (Blue Teaming)

Monitoring and detecting suspicious behavior.

Observing network and system activity.

Example:

Detecting logins from unusual locations.

15. Incident Response

Triggered when suspicious activity is confirmed.

Steps include:

Containment

Threat removal

System restoration

Returning business to normal operations

16. Threat Intelligence

Gathering information about:

Attacker methods

Targets

Latest trends

Helps strengthen organizational defenses.

17. Vulnerability Management

Identifying system flaws.

Patching software regularly.

Reducing attack surface proactively.
